Software Developer with expertise in creating front-end and back-end applications. Skilled with JavaScript, Python, React, Redux, Node, and Jest.

In my spare time, I love to watch anime, read manga and immerse myself in sneaker-twitter.

If you'd like to know more about me or how I operate, don't be afraid to shoot me a message on LinkedIn or checkout my portfolio for other contact options. I'm always excited to connect with other developers!
